# User Microservice

User Microservice is built with NestJS framework, designed to manage user data. It provides comprehensive functionalities for user management, including CRUD operations, user blocking/unblocking, and user search capabilities. MongoDB is used for storing user data, while Redis is employed for caching to enhance performance.
